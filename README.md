# Leptospirosis_Detection

This repository contains the code and data for detecting leptospirosis using machine learning models. The primary models used are Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. The data is preprocessed and various hyperparameter tuning techniques are applied to achieve optimal performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `train.csv`, which includes multiple features related to patient information and clinical data.
